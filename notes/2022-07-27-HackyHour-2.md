## What are Jupyter Notebooks

- Jupyter Notbooks are a combination of code and explanatory text.
- It can process code of 12 different programming languages
- Key Advantage: A notebook contains both **code and its output**.
- A notebook is therefore human readable and executable
- Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to communicate scientific analysis
- They are also great for developing code and doing stepwise data analysis because the cell structure facilitates running small code sections

- You can write text in markdown
- You can link to external source
- It runs in your browser (creates local server)

## Use cases

- Documenting a process
- Tutorials e.g. in teaching scientific analysis
- Show how things are used
- Enables learners to try things out
- Data analysis
- Code development
- Create figures 

## Tasks you can solve with Jupyter Notebooks are

- Transformation and cleaning of data
- Data visualisation
- Statistical modelling

# Topic: Ansible
- Presenter: Christian Krippes
- Talk title: 'HackyHour #10 Ansible'
- Date: 24.05.2023

## What is Ansible

- Open Source Software (GPL)
- Written in Python
- Developed by Michael DeHaan
- Enables infrastructre as code
- Works on Unix-like systems and Windows

## Use cases

**Premise**  
_You have to take care of three or more computers.
E.g servers, raspberry-pi fleet, family-sys-admin_

- Install software 
- Configure: software, operating-system, user
- Deploy an application.

## Why Ansible

- easy to learn (YAML and Jinja)
- (almost) no dependencies other than python
- no agents, just SSH
- "safe"- no unexpacted behaviour
- IMHO very good documentation

## General advantages

- Its like code
- One control node, arbitrary managed nodes
- Declaritive configuration
- Well written "playbooks" are ideompotent 
=> Nothing is changed if the desired state is already present
- Version control

## Disadvantages

- Adds complexity
- Changes (OS, Ansible) might break your playbook
- Learning curve
- Great Power -> Great Responsibility

## How to use it

Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user ansible
```

## How to use it

Inventory files are used to describe your server environment.
Here we reference three servers by hostname (e.g.,`gui.local`) and IP-Address.
The `[gui]` indicates a group with the name `gui`. All referenced servers under this indicator
are part of the group.
You can also create a group of groups; see, for example, the group `multi`.

```ini
# First group with name 'gui'
[gui]
gui.local ansible_host=192.168.60.4

[app]
app.local ansible_host=192.168.60.5

[db]
db.local ansible_host=192.168.60.6

# A group of groups with name 'multi'
[multi:children]
app
db
gui

# Variables that will be applied to all servers
[multi:vars]
# Ansible has a lot of reserved variables
# ansible_user is the user Ansible uses for the SSH connection.
ansible_user=vagrant
# this does as the name says and sets a specific private key.
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
```

## How to use it

One way to use Ansible is through the command line via so-called "ad-hoc commands.
With ad-hoc commands, you can send a command to all your servers, a group, or a single server.
Ansible then returns the result to the command line.

Example that copies the `/etc/hosts` file to `/tmp/hosts`

```bash
ansible -i hosts.ini multi -m ansible.builtin.copy -a "src=/etc/hosts dest=/tmp/hosts"
```  

**-i** path to inventory file  
**all** a pattern to filter the inventory file  
**-m** select a ansible module  
**-a** pass arguments to the module  
**src=** path to file that we want to copy  
**dest=** path to new location 

## How to use it

If you want to execute more commands or group commands together,
then a playbook becomes useful.

- YAML files
- Declare a sequence of **tasks** on a selection of **hosts**
- Sequence of **tasks** is a **play**. You can have more than one play per playbook
- You can import one playbook into another
- You can import tasks from a tasks file
- Playbooks enable the full power of ansible

```yaml
---
# First we filter our inventory, we want to run this playbook on all servers of the inventory.
- hosts: all
  # Gather facts is useful when you need facts about the controlled machine, like hostname, OS, OS-Version etc.
  gather_facts: false
  # Become indicates to Ansible that we need to escalate our privileges
  become: true
  # We use sudo for privilege escalation
  become_method: sudo
  # This section prompts the user who runs the playbook to input a username and password
  # The username is then stored in `new_user_name` and the password is in `my_password`
  vars_prompt:
    - name: new_user_name
      prompt: What is your username?
      private: false
    
    # The passwords need to be hashed (here sha512_crypt).
    - name: my_password
      prompt: Enter a new password(avoid %,{)
      private: true
      encrypt: sha512_crypt
      confirm: true
      salt_size: 7
  
  # Here begins the sequence of tasks
  tasks:
    # This is the first task
    - name: Add new sudo-user
      # It uses the Ansible module `user` to create a new user.
      ansible.builtin.user:
        # Ansible wants you to write variables like this.
        name: "{{ new_user_name }}"
        shell: /bin/bash
        create_home: true
        append: true
        groups: sudo, adm
        password: "{{ my_password }}"
```

## How to use it

Playbooks

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini --ask-become-pass add_admin_user.yml
```

 **--ask-become-pass** prompt for sudo password

# About
Come to talk about Code, Data, Tools and Science in a social environment.
If you want to know how computational tools and code can improve your science/work or you just want to meet “open scienc-y” people: join us.
The event is open to everyone. No prior knowledge required. No registration etc. needed.

If you'd like to watch a video about what HackyHour is, Florian explained it in a [Coffee Lecture][coffee].

# When and Where
We'll meet monthly **every fourth Wednesday at 5 pm** for one and a half hours in the [Makerspace Giessen](https://makerspace-giessen.de/).
[Location on OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/8079176031).

Please bring your own computer, as we cannot provide any resources in this regard and then can also work through installations.

# About
Come to talk about science in a social environment.
If you want to know how computational tools and code can improve your science or you just want to drink a beer: join us.

# When and Where
*State when the meeting will take place* at the [PUT-YOUR-LOCATION-HERE](https://maybe-place-a-google-maps-link-or-something-similar-here.com).
You can come without registration but feel free to join the discussion in the linked pad (see table below) if you have any questions beforehand.
Usually we order pizza and sit together until roughly 8pm.

# Topics
In addition to the open discussions we also aim to talk about specific topics at each HackyHour.
However prior knowledge or interest in these topics is not a prerequisite.
Online discussions for these topics are accessible via the following links.

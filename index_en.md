# HackyHour Giessen

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è Go back](/index.md) to the German version of this page.

## What is the HackyHour?

We meet once a month in a relaxed atmosphere and talk about code, data, tools and science. The HackyHour is open to anyone interested and you can simply drop by without registering in advance. The topics vary from time to time. Below you can find a list of [upcoming](#upcoming-dates)  and [past dates](#past-dates).

The presentations will be held in German. In this way, we want to break down barriers in the technical area and remain beginner-friendly.

Florian once explained the HackyHour in English during a [Coffee Lecture][coffee].

## When and Where

Every fourth Wednesday at 5 pm for about one and a half hours in the [Makerspace Giessen](https://makerspace-giessen.de/).[ More on how to get there](https://makerspace-giessen.de/allgemeines/#anfahrt).

You don't need to bring anything. If you have a laptop, bring it along; there's bound to be something to try out!

## Upcoming dates

In addition to the open discussion that is always possible, we always try to talk about at least one specific topic. Usually one person introduces the topic and then there is time for questions and discussion. If you would also like to present something, please get in touch with us (see contact below).

## Contact

If you want to present an issue, you can simply open an issue in GitHub or contact [Christian Krippes](mailto:christian.krippes@bibsys.uni-giessen.de). You also always have the opportunity to talk to us at the HackyHour itself or to present your topic directly afterwards if there is still time. The presentations are freely customizable.

## Past Dates

The past dates were mainly in English, so the notes are also mainly in English. From HackyHour 15 onwards, we will try to offer the notes in German and English.
